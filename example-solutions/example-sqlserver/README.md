# MikeyT.DbMigrations example solution - SqlServer

See [ExampleSolutions.md](../../docs/ExampleSolutions.md).

**Note:** The SQL Server instance takes a lot longer to start up when running `swig dockerUp` compared to a PostgreSQL database, which might result in errors when running DB related swig commands before it's initialized. Give it at least 20 seconds to finish starting up. If creating a brand new DB, it will take even longer the first time - perhaps 1 or 2 minutes.
